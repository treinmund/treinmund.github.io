The authors conduct pre- and post-deployment observations and interviews to understand the nurses workflow with and without the DL system, and evaluate the system’s performance as it is used in a clinical setting. The study points to the importance of contextual evaluations, as they can reveal social and environmental factors which impact model performance that would otherwise be abstracted from in a laboratory setting.",
